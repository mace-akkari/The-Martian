# The Martian React project

```
In "The Martian," astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on Mars. In order to contact with NASA, 
Watney digs up the Mars Pathfinder, the probe which NASA lost contact with in 1997. 
He decides to use a hexadecimal system, which has 16 characters, to communicate instead. 
The problem? NASA can't communicate back. All they have is a camera on a platform which 
can rotate 360 degrees. 

That's a start. The camera can point to things like "yes" and "no." 
It can even point to an alphabet. However, since the camera moves in a circle, 
it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for each of the English language's 26 letters. 
Watney has to get creative, so he decides to use a hexadecimal system, 
which has 16 characters, to communicate instead. 
The hexadecimal system is comprised of 16 symbols: 0-9 and A-F.
